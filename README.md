# Image-and-video-steganography
Recent advancements in steganography analysis have made it more challenging to use
steganography to secure private messages, digital photos, or other materials. The
presence of concealed information in carrier files is amply demonstrated by
steganography analysis. The strategy employed in this the project centres on the
application of both steganographic and cryptographic methods. By doing this, we can
retain the data more securely, preventing unauthorised network users from accessing
the data that is already available. The message from the data should only be decoded
by the sender and receiver.In this project we first encrypt textual data and then hide it in images and video.
